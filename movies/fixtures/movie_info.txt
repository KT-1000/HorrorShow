Both film showcased Karacadag's growing ability to shock and terrify his audiences by taking the rich folklore of his country and pushing it to its dark extremes. And he's at it again with D@BB: Bir Cin Vakasi.

One of the recruits, Tan, the introverted platoon outcast, is adamant that he will be the next victim of the mad woman's spirit. He tries to convince his buddy Jeremy that the woman's spirit has been visiting him every night. Jeremy laughs it off and claims that there are no such things as ghosts in this world. They only exist because of Tan's overactive imagination. However, during the 24 km road march for the platoon in the forest, Tan was found dead by the river, with his limbs contorted in a strange way and an expression of deep fear on his face. Overwhelmed with guilt, Jeremy decides to investigate Tan's death, convinced that it was not an accident as what the military officers believe. Little does he know that the truth behind Tan's death will unearth a terrible dark secret of the island and he will have to confront his deepest fears in order to find the truth.|Mandarin|Singapore|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3Mjk4NDMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0Nzg1OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt2100376.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2100376|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt2100376&plot=full&r=json|True

He is actually a burglar with his arms intact. He and his accomplice, Cojo (a little person), are hiding from the police, and Alonzo views his disguise as perfect, especially since it keeps from view an unusual deformity of his left hand that would immediately give him away as the burglar. Nanon, the daughter of the circus owner, is the target in his act. Although Alonzo is in love with her, Nanon's father despises him. Nanon is attracted to Malabar, the circus strong man, but she is also repulsed by his uninhibited sexual advances and desire to touch and hold her. Apparently her phobia extends to the touch of any man. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is "armless." Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzo's face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her father's murderer. Alonzo decides to have his left arm amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. He thinks Nanon will forgive him for hiding the fact that he has ONE arm. While Alonzo is recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar. Discovering this upon his return, Alonzo hatches a scheme to kill Mirabar as he attempts his latest, most daring stunt.

The Dementias strike it rich when the boys' project appears on the Evening News, and it convinces a Hong Kong-based company to flood the market with an inexpensive black-market version of Microsoft Windows called Chindows. The entire Dementia Family, thanks to young Carmine and Salvadore, have now become dot-com millionaires. With the rest of the dysfunctional Dementia family sporting only grade-school educations at best, the Dementias begin to flaunt their new-found wealth. As they begin to convert their modest Long Island home into a white statue-laden mansion, the first order of business is to construct a haunted house for Halloween to impress their working-class neighbors, who are portrayed by movie stars and comedians in cameo roles.

So trick-or-treating at the Dementias each year makes one wonder what is a gag and what is real. With Chindows flooding the market, things begin to go awry.

When images of Nicholas's absent father start to appear to him, the boy is understandably frightened. This curious figure gives Nicholas the impression he is pressing his young son closer to the girls in his life and away from Bobby. This only leads to increased anxiety and fear in Nicholas. Fearing that Bobby is drifting away from him, Nicholas takes a chance and kisses him. Bobby is taken aback and storms out. Because of his shame, Bobby undergoes a type of 'splitting' where a decrepit, ghoulish version of him is separated from his healthy self.

tt0800361|5708|S&man|2006|R|10 Mar 2006|84 min|Horror|S&MAN begins with footage from Michael Powell's exploration of voyeurism, "Peeping Tom." Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called "S&Man," where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and mainstream horror classics like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" proves even more unsettling. Using interviews with Carol Clover (author off the definitive horror book, "Men, Women, and Chainsaws), and his personal experience as a horror director, Petty suggests that viewers' interest in horror films is rooted in the same voyeuristic urge to which these fetish videos appeal. Ulitmately, Petty directly confronts the audience, forcing them to examine their fascination with horror, torture, and violence.

tt4045384|0|Writers Retreat|2015|N/A|16 Oct 2015|N/A|Drama, Horror, Thriller|WRITERS RETREAT is a horror film written by Jeremy Sheldon & C.M. Taylor set on fictional Kilton Island where strangers come together to develop their writing. Mark Twain famously said: "Write what you know". But how far would you go to find material for the ultimate bestseller? At a writer's retreat on an isolated island, novelist Zandra finds herself amongst a group of strangers confronting their darkest secrets as they write. When a member of the party mysteriously disappears, Zandra fears there is a more sinister presence trapped on the island with them. WRITERS RETREAT is filmed in a classic British Hammer Horror style using the strange features of its location to create a hauntingly terrifying film with atmosphere and menace. The script delves deep into human emotions and honesty, causing the characters to ask questions about themselves that they didn't know they had and question the audience as to whether things are quite what they seem.|English|UK|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NzQ1Mzk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI1OTAzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt4045384.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4045384|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt4045384&plot=full&r=json|True

Brookdale has another, more lucrative facet; a safe harbor for the chronically drug-addicted rich and famous, especially the sons and daughters of the above, whose families have tried everything. "The Institute" is also for the once-famous, who, having bottomed out, also have no where else to turn but Brookdale. Investigating possible health code violations, "Jennifer/Samantha", (Sara Downing), a career-driven reporter for "The Philadelphia Enquirer", checks in under the guise of a patient, in hope of getting a hot story. Unbeknownst to her, the real scoop is much more awesome then even she could write about, should she live to tell. Brookdale is infested with super-intelligent, supernaturally empowered killer rats, a by-product of forgotten experiments conducted by "Dr. William Winslow" (Ron Perlman), the Chief Psychiatrist at Brookdale. Winslow had abandoned the experiments long ago, however ex-patient/caretaker, "Ernst" (Michael Zelniker) has developed a symbiotic, telepathic relationship with the rodents, and they thrive off of each other.

In 1671, hundreds of men, women, and children suffered in bloody, torturous rituals at the hands of priests unable to contain the evil of the possessed. Were these possessions real, or is the story a hoax to cover up the sins of the deranged priests thirsty for human blood? Bill and his team of cynical paranormal investigators plan to find out the truth. As the producer and host of the reality TV show "Ghost Seekers," Bill and his crew have seen it all: abandoned prisons, haunted houses, and decrepit mental hospitals. Night after night of boring trips to empty run down buildings has left them sure that the dead stay dead and that ghosts are the furthest thing from being real. Their lack of faith will soon be repaid in blood. Armed with the church's historical record, they set out into the wilderness to uncover this series of forgotten atrocities. The demons of the past are invited to return and the gory details of old sins are revealed as the possessed begin hunting the living. Alternately gut-punching hilarious and brutally violent, The Cemetery takes the best elements of the old-school slasher film and pushes them to the edge.|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTE1NDM5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEyMTc5Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt1844793.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844793|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt1844793&plot=full&r=json|True

They've got to finish studying for their finals, take the tests themselves, and then school's out for good. The party has come just at the right time, and is just what Christian needs; right up until the point his sister commits suicide in an upstairs bathroom. Exams and graduation completed, Sofie's unexplained suicide is still affecting everyone concerned, especially Christian, who is convinced that Sofie was trying to tell him something before she killed herself at the party. But life has to go on, and before they all have to split up and go their own way Christian and his friends decide to go on their traditional trip to Sweden to celebrate midsummer for one last time. Although the group's usual rituals in connection with the midsummer trip aren't the same without Sofie, everyone does their best to enjoy themselves. And when Christian's long held, yet unrequited feelings for the beautiful Trine finally appear to be reciprocated, it looks like the trip is going to turn out just fine anyway. But then Christian discovers that someone - or something - has decided that Sofie's suicide should not go unexplained - and one night he wakes up with the feeling that Sofie is in the room with him. Has Sofie really come back? Or are Christian's feelings of guilt and sorrow over Sofie's apparently meaningless death making him imagine things? The dreadful truth is lurking in the dark shadows cast by the fir trees in the Swedish forest.

Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet-or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles.|English|USA,tigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down.

Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. She survives, but her cell mate doesn't. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of more victims, and of the nearly-successful capture of the Jigsaw Killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims. Instead, he finds ways to make them kill either themselves, or each other, and he thinks the entire 'game' out perfectly, with no other ways out. Or so it would seem.|English|USA, Australia|http:/daughter run from their home after assailants destroy it.
