Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. She survives, but her cell mate doesn't. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of more victims, and of the nearly-successful capture of the Jigsaw Killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims. Instead, he finds ways to make them kill either themselves, or each other, and he thinks the entire 'game' out perfectly, with no other ways out.

When he, his son, Billy Drayton, and his neighbor Brent Norton travel to the supermarket, the unthinkable happens. On their way to the market, they see the army, firefighters, and the police heading toward the mist. When he sees this Brent mentions something about "Project Arrowhead", a secret military project that no one knows about. As they are shopping, they see three soldiers walk in, pick up a few things, then head toward the mist. All eighty of the store's shoppers have no clue what is going on until an old man runs in the market with a bloody nose and declares "Something in the mist!" He tells them to close the door. About five seconds after they close the door, the entire store shakes, as though it has been lifted several feet above the ground. When David is asked to check on the generator, he finds the loading dock door being pushed on by something outside. Then Dave hears a groan. He asks three people to come with him. When Norm the bag-boy volunteers to go out, he is dragged away by a creature with large squid-like tentacles that have mouths, teeth, and arms. After Dave and the other three fight off the tentacles, they warn everyone in the store what is out there. Upon hearing this, Mrs. Carmody exclaims that it is the End Time and that God is punishing them. People don't believe it, but finally Mrs. Carmody has almost everyone in the store on her side. Does 'Project Arrowhead' have anything to do with this? Will Dave Drayton, his son, and his friends make it out alive as they make a last stand against this destruction? Or will they be taken by the demon-like creatures of 'The Mist'?|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NjQyNDY1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk1MDU1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0884328.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0884328&plot=full&r=json|True

Mayor Larry Vaughn is welcoming developer Len Peterson and his new resort to Amity. Two scuba divers are exploring the area where the Orca sank after police chief Martin Brody killed a huge shark four years ago. A shark shows up and devoured the two divers, but not before one of the divers takes a close-up picture of the shark's eye, and sometime later, while a mother is driving a boat that's pulling her water-skiing teenage daughter, the shark devours the daughter and causes the mother to accidentally blow up the boat, then a killer whale is found on the shore with a huge bites on it. After Brody sees this, he knows there's another huge great white shark in Amity's waters, but Vaughn and Peterson explain these attacks away as non-shark accidents, because the thought of another shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from the new resort and cause the new resort to lose money. It looks like Vaughn is still a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Brody tips his gun's hollow point bullets with cyanide and melted candle wax and tells his sons Michael and Sean to stay away from the beaches and told them to not go sailing with Mike's friends, who include Vaughn's son Larry Vaughn Jr. Everyone thinks Brody's fears are shark trauma-induced paranoia. Brody even tries to call his friend Matt Hooper, who is doing research on a boat in the Antarctic Circle, and Matt will be in the Antarctic Circle for a few more months. While keeping an eye on the waters from the beach's shark tower, Brody sees a huge dark spot in the water and rings the tower's alarm bell, but it turns out to be a school of bluefish. Vaughn fires Brody for causing this panic at the beach and scaring tourists and their money away, and even though they were told not to, Michael and Sean go out sailing with Junior Vaughn and their friends, unaware that the shark is trailing them.

Nicolas is curious, thinks that he is being lied to and starts to explore his environment, witnessing some unsettling scenes. He then finds himself taken to a hospital-like building where he along, with the others, undergoes a series of medical procedures by the women, dressed as nurses. He is befriended by one nurse, who becomes instrumental in the film's denouement. The film is not easy to categorise; it is not only enigmatic but beautifully filmed with deeply poetic imagery. It reflects the fear of the unknown, experienced by a boy on the cusp of adolescence.|French|France, Belgium, Spain|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTc4MTk3NTQtZTA0Mi00YzBjLWE0NTQtNDVhYTcyMjdiMWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY4Mjk3MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt4291590.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291590|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt4291590&plot=full&r=json|True

This causes them to strip off his clothes and beat him up in front of the entire school. Flash forward to 2001. We meet the five girls who were in that school gym: Kate, Paige, Shelly, Lily and the formerly plump Dorothy. They are all in their 20's now and trying to sort out their love lives, which is appropriate, since Valentine's Day is coming up. After a disastrous date with a loser, one of the girls, a pre-med student, is murdered by a Cherub-mask wearing killer who sent her a death threat in the form of a Valentine card prior to the attack. After the four remaining girls are reunited at her funeral, they all start receiving threatening cards and messages. At first they don't know who would want to hurt them, but eventually they figure that maybe Jeremy is responsible. Police records show that Jeremy has completely disappeared, so no one knows what he looks like.

That obsession takes a slight change in focus when John believes that Anna is trying to pass along information to help others. But the nature of those messages and their connection to Raymond in combination with John learning that not all good comes through EVP leads to the possible belief that he dabbling in EVP in and of itself may be dangerous and the cause of those potentially deadly issues in which he is supposed to assist in helping. John has to decide whether or not to continue with his work in EVP, not continuing which means that he may actually prevent bad things from happening, and continuing which means that he gets his much wanted connection with Anna.|English|UK, Canada, USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTA0NDQ1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM4Mjk2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0375210.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375210|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0375210&plot=full&r=json|True

tt3958632|0|The Offering|2015|N/A|22 Aug 2015|N/A|Horror|The Offering - Studio Coverage. This script is a gory thriller reminiscent of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance. The writer builds the tension slowly, using humorous foreshadowing early in the script when Mr. Meakins states, "You wouldn't believe the sacrifices we've made." The ominous fact that someone barricaded the doors from inside the house ignites the reader's imagination and the suspense that will eventually crescendo into a full-blown bloodbath at the climax of the script. The writer of this script definitely has a good grasp of the genre and of storytelling.

tt1386925|20400|The Dead|2010|R|01 Oct 2011|105 min|Horror|Lieutenant Brian Murphy, is the sole survivor of the final plane out of Africa, which crashes somewhere off the coast of West Africa. The night before, a zombie horde attacked many villages in that area. Brian gathers supplies from the plane crash and travels by foot until he finds and fixes a broken-down truck in a village. When driving, the truck gets stuck in a pothole as zombies get closer. Daniel Dembele, a local African soldier gone AWOL in search of his son, rescues Brian from certain death. Daniel's wife had been killed in a zombie attack the previous night and a local military unit, heading north to a military base, had rescued his son. Daniel agrees to lead Brian to the nearest airport, a day's drive away, in exchange for his truck upon arrival for Daniel to use to find his son. At the airport, Brian attempts radioing for help using the air traffic tower's radio, but he receives no response. Daniel gets fuel for the truck and the two agree it would be best to stick together and attempt to travel to the military base, with Daniel hoping his son is there and Brian hoping they have a plane he can repair to fly back to the United States. They rest for a night at a village that has been converted to a survival camp by a group of local soldiers. They leave the following morning. While driving through the African plains, the truck hits a tree, breaking the vehicle. Brian and Daniel continue on foot and sleep around a fire for the night. A zombie horde attacks the group in their sleep, leaving Daniel bitten and badly wounded. They manage to shoot their way out of the attack and continue moving forward. Daniel tells Brian of a necklace he wears and that he planned to pass down to his son. Daniel succumbs to his wounds soon thereafter. Brian continues the trek alone to the northern military base. After an eventful journey through dangerous and rough terrain, Brian reaches the base, which has become a survival camp. He repairs an old radio unit in the base and broadcasts his name, managing to reach fellow American military officer Frank Greaves at a U.S. military base in Nevada. It is revealed that the epidemic has reached the United States, which is rapidly failing to hold out. When Brian asks about his family, Frank informs him that "they're gone." Zombies invade the U.S. military base, ending the radio transmission. Brian goes back outside as zombies overwhelm the gates around the camp and begin killing all the survivors. At the last moment, Daniel's son approaches Brian, seeing his father's necklace in his hand. They hold hands and turn to face the overwhelming horde that approaches them.|English|UK|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjU1MTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM4ODUyNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt1386925.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386925|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt1386925&plot=full&r=json|True

The only people who regularly see her are her hard-as-nails but seemingly loyal housekeeper Velma Crowther, and her longtime friend and physician, Dr. Drew Bayliss. She has lived there the better part of her life except for a short stint in London thirty-seven years ago following the vicious murder of her married lover, John Mayhew, at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. That evening, she and John were going to run off together, that is before he was bludgeoned to death, his right hand and head which were never found. No one was ever convicted for his murder, but most people believe Charlotte did it after John changed his mind about running off with her. Not having seen her in years, they also now believe Charlotte is a crazy old woman, her mental state which turned at or before the murder. Conversely, Charlotte has hidden away as she fears people would always be glaring at her. She also believes any bad thing that has happened to her following John's murder has been initiated by John's widow, Jewel Mayhew, who Charlotte blames for orchestrating the expropriation of her property to build a bridge across the lake. Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin, Miriam Deering, who left the area years ago never to have returned and who was once Drew's romantic interest, has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion. While Charlotte wanted Miriam to help her overturn the expropriation with the state government in Baton Rouge, Miriam has instead come to help Charlotte pack her belongings. Miriam's visit coincides with the arrival to Hollisport of insurance investigator Harry Willis, who has always had an interest in this case in why the insurance was never claimed. Not expecting to find anything earth shattering while not wanting to upset the apple cart, he doesn't let anyone know except Sheriff Luke Standish the true nature of his visit. These visits also coincide with Charlotte's mental state seemingly going into decline, perhaps concerning having to leave her family home, but the issues which are always around John's murder. Or is someone or some people trying to drive her crazy if she is not so already? If the latter, the truth behind who killed John and why may finally come to light to those who matter.|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNDI3MzA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM1MDAzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0058213.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058213|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0058213&plot=full&r=json|True

A lonely, unfriendly, sexually repressed fellow, Mark is obsessed with the effects of fear and how they are registered on the face and behavior of the frightened. This obsession dates from the time when, as a child, he served as the subject of some cold-blooded experiments in the psychology of terror conducted by his own scientist father. As a grown man, Mark becomes a compulsive murderer who kills women and records their contorted features and dying gasps on film. His ongoing project is a documentary on fear.

Alone in his room, he surrounds himself with the sights and sounds of terror: taped screams, black-and-white "home movies" of convulsed faces. At his house, he meets Helen Stephens, a young woman who lives with her blind mother in a downstairs flat.

They feel they can't turn down the rent deal offered to them by the house's owners, siblings Roz and Arnold Allardyce, despite some reservations. First amongst those reservations, they are to take care of the house on their own, which Ben feels is too big a job, especially for Marian and the interior housekeeping. In Marian's words, the large size of the house is a "waste". And second and perhaps more important amongst those reservations, the Allardyces' aged mother will be staying in her room at the house, the Rolfs who are to provide a tray of food left outside her room three times a day, which Marian vows to take care of on her own, with no other members of the family to go into that isolated wing of the house so as not to disturb Mrs. Allardyce's peace. Upon their arrival at the house for the first day of their stay, they find a note from Roz and Arnold stating that they had to leave on an emergency, only with the necessary keys enclosed with no address or telephone number where they can be reached. As the summer progresses, the family members individually begin to exhibit unusual and unexplainable behavior, and unusual and unexplainable things start happening around the house. The strongest behavior ends up being Marian's total focus on renewing the house into what she says she wants it to be, or so she implies she is doing. These occurrences threaten both the loving family dynamic as well as the individual lives of the four. The answers to what is happening may be who or what lies behind the closed and often locked door of Mrs. Allardyce's bedroom.|English|USA, Italy|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNzYzNTc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwNTkyMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0074258.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074258|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0074258&plot=full&r=json|True

Dr. Timothy Darrow, branded 'The American Cannibal' by the press during his trial, defended himself with an alibi that was insane. Beyond impossible. He claimed a mythic human-ape creature was responsible for the murders. In 2003, the remains of a species matching Darrow's description were found. In the very same jungles of Indonesia. It is now regarded as one of the most important anthropological finds ever: a team of scientists discovered the bones of an entirely new species of human, one that stood only three feet tall. But did they go extinct? An indigenous tribe on the Indonesian island of Flores, where the hobbit remains were discovered, have their own accounts of little wild men that climb trees and walk on two feet. They also describe them as cannibals. And according to their legend, they may never have died out at all... This is a story following a present-day expedition deep into the jungle interior of Flores, Indonesia, to find evidence if hobbits still survive. It is also a story of Dr. Timothy Darrow's ill-fated expedition from 1977, and whether he and his team really encountered a creature thousands of years after it supposedly went extinct, and if the American Cannibal could be innocent of the crimes he was convicted of more than three decades ago.|English|USA, Philippines, UK|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYjJkMjFjMmMtZGIwYS00NDhiLWJjZDItZDMwMWIyYjFjMWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU0NzkwMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt4716958.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4716958|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt4716958&plot=full&r=json|True

His biggest fan, Lakeridge High School student and resident metal head Eddie Weinbauer is devastated by the news and turns to local radio DJ "Nuke" for emotional support. After a heated discussion about the deceased rock star, Nuke presents Eddie with a rare demo record, the last ever recorded by Sammi and the only copy in existence. Overwhelmed by Nuke's generosity, Eddie accepts the gift without hesitation, unaware of it's dark role in things to come. After constant humiliation and a near drowning at the hands of school bully Tim Hainy and his sports jock friends, Eddie becomes enraged and vows revenge on all those who have wronged him, much to the dismay of love interest, Leslie and best friend, Roger. Alone in his room with feelings of rage and retribution racing through his mind, Eddie places the new record onto his stereo and is shocked to discover that he can communicate with the deceased rock star when it is rotated backwards. Playing upon both Eddie's loyalty and emotional vulnerability, Sammi instructs the teenager on how to get back at those who have caused him so much pain, instructions that the easily manipulated Eddie carries out, prompting the usual 'underdog gets his own back' results. At first it's all fun and games as Hainy and his cohorts get their just desserts, but when Hainy's girlfriend is nearly killed by supernatural forces, Eddie realizes that he is nothing more than a pawn in a much more sinister plot and wants out. When Eddie tries to destroy the record, an evil version of Sammi is resurrected (complete with supernatural powers) and goes on a rampage at the high school Halloween dance, turning Eddie's involvement with the devilish rock star into a spine tingling nightmare not only for the young headbanger, but for his school and hometown as well. Can Eddie stop the demonic Sammi before he sends the entire town straight to hell?

Set in the 1930s Oklahoma Dust Bowl, the untimely death of Charlotte's mother triggers a downward spiral for her father, five sisters and their family-run song and dance act. Help comes from an unlikely source when a gangster named Randall (Iwan Rheon) offers to pay off their debt in exchange for making some unsavoury changes to the family business. Matters are complicated when it is discovered that Charlotte, like her mother before her, is in fact a mermaid capable of controlling humans with her voice. What follows is a sophisticated magical turf war in which antagonists from many camps seek to take advantage of Charlotte's power.

Five years later, the abandoned Balfour house comes to life again with the arrival of two sinister-looking tenants: a fiendish-looking man with pointed teeth, bulging eyes and a tall beaver hat, and a pale young woman in a long gown. The presence of the strangers prompts Sir James, who lives next door, to call in Inspector Burke again. Also living in the Hamlin household are the other people who were also present in Balfour's house the night he died: Sir James' nephew, Arthur Hibbs; the late Balfour's now-grown daughter, Lucille; and Williams, the butler. Burke expresses skepticism about Sir James' suspicions that the new neighbors might have been involved in Balfour's death, until strange things start happening: Balfour's body disappears from its tomb. The new maid, Smithson, tells a terrifying tale of being menaced in Lucille's bedroom by the stranger in the beaver hat. And a man spotted inside the Balfour house by Burke and Sir James looks distinctly like the late Roger Balfour. A skittish Arthur becomes convinced the neighbors are vampires. Burke takes Lucille aside, and tells her he doesn't believe her father committed suicide. He asks her to trust him. Burke also has a private talk with Arthur. Burke uses hypnosis to put Arthur into a trance, but learns nothing new about Balfour's death. That night, someone fires a shot into Arthur's room, but Arthur isn't there; instead, it's Burke who's slightly wounded. Lucille is abducted by the beaver-hatted man and the butler and brought to her former home. Sir James, acting at Burke's instruction, also shows up at the Balfour house; he's met out front by the beaver-hatted man, who puts him into a hypnotic trance. Arthur breaks into the Balfour house in an attempt to rescue Lucille; he's caught by Burke and a couple of detectives and locked away. It turns out the man with the beaver hat and pointed teeth was really a disguised Inspector Burke, who was aided at times by a double; Smithson, the maid, is an assistant detective; the mysterious young woman, a stage performer working for the police. Under Burke's hypnosis, Sir James re-creates his actions the night Roger Balfour died, with Lucille and the butler, Williams, playing themselves, and Burke's double playing the part of Balfour. It turns out Sir James shot and killed Balfour and made the death appear a suicide after Balfour rejected Sir James as a future husband for young Lucille. Sir James is brought out of his trance and arrested by Burke. The mystery of Balfour's death solved, Lucille and Arthur, who have come to realize how much they love each other, are now free to marry.|N/A|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2ODMwMTY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzcwNTM4MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0018097.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018097|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0018097&plot=full&r=json|True

tt1712578|7942|The Devil's Rock|2011|N/A|22 Sep 2011|83 min|Horror|On, June 5, 1944 in the early morning hours before the opening of the invasion on D-Day, a commando team, consisting of two New Zealander's, Captain Ben Grogan (Craig Hall) and Sergeant Joseph Tane (Karlos Drinkwater), land on the one of the Channel Islands, which are occupied by the German Army. Their mission is to sabotage installations there to create a distraction from the actual landings at Normandy. Using kayaks they land on the beach, navigate the land mines, then climb up to their target: a large artillery gun overlooking the English Channel. They are confused by the lack of German patrols on the island and puzzled by strange screams coming from the German's main bunker. They find the gun unguarded and wire it with explosives. While they are placing the charges a German soldier (Luke Hawker) comes running out of the entrance of the underground bunker. Although he seems less concerned about running into the enemy than getting away from something in the bunker, the New Zealanders kill him, so he can't give away the mission. Captain Grogan becomes curious as to the screams from the bunker as they appear to be coming from a woman. He makes a decision to go on an unauthorized rescue mission, leaving a reluctant Tane behind. Tane eventually decides to follow Grogan into the bunker. Inside he finds the command center a scene of unbelievable carnage, with German soldier's bodies torn asunder and blood all over the walls. He also finds a book which seems to contain satanic spells in a foreign language. Tane isn't alone in the command center. SS Colonel Klaus Meyer (Matthew Sunderland) comes up behind Tane, kills him and retrieves the book, leaving Tane dead on the floor. Grogan, unable to find the source of the screams, backtracks and finds the command center along with Tane's body. He is also attacked by Meyer. Meyer doesn't kill him though, but captures him, ties him up and tries to get information out of Grogan about the coming invasion. He finds a picture of Grogan's dead wife, Helena, who was killed during the bombing of London and threatens to burn it to torture him. They are interrupted again by the woman's screams. Grogan states he believes that the German's captured a woman and used her for entertainment and then Meyer got greedy, wanted her to himself and killed the rest of the soldiers. Meyer laughs at this and tells Grogan that the "woman" did all the killing. He then tells Grogan he needs to feed it. Scooping some human entrails into a bucket, he leaves the room. While Meyer is gone, Grogan is able to grab and conceal a small can opener behind his back. When the German returns, he seems more reasonable and tells Grogan that the "woman" he hears is actually a demonic creature. German soldiers found the satanic book on the island. The island has a long history of witchery. Meyer, a specialist in the occult, was sent to the island to see if it had any value as a military weapon. He found a spell and successfully conjured up the demon, but it turned out that the creature was a shape-shifter that can appear as any woman a man desires. The demon used this power to lure the soldiers close, kill them and eat them. Meyer tells Grogan he wants to defect to the Allies and needs Grogan to assist him in sending the creature back to hell, a job that requires two people. Grogan thinks Meyer is crazy. While they are talking he uses the can opener to cut his bonds and attacks the German. There is struggle. Grogan gets Meyer's pistol. Meyers runs off into the darkness of a bunker tunnel while Grogan shoots at him. Grogan find blood on the floor and realizes that the German has been hit. Grogan follows the woman's screams and finds a chamber that looks like it has been used for a satanic ritual with markings on the walls and floors lit with candles. Around the room are of the remains of dead soldiers and crouching in the corner is the figure of a woman (Gina Varela). When she emerges from the shadows Grogan is shocked to find it appears to be his dead wife. She pleads for him to release her as she is chained to the wall by her foot. Meyers, appears at the door holding a rifle. He warns Grogan that the woman is not his wife and shoots her in the head and she falls to the floor. Grogan, enraged, tries to shoot Meyers with pistol, but it's out of rounds. Meyers chops off the leg of one of the corpses and tosses it the woman, who suddenly revives, stands up and shifts into a red-skinned female creature with horns and sharp teeth. It begins to gnaw on the leg. Convinced that it isn't his dead wife, Grogan goes back to the command center with Meyers, who is bleeding from a stomach wound. He agrees to help Meyers dispel the demon and allow him defect to the Allies side. First, however, the bullet must be removed from Meyers if he is to heal. Grogan does this, but without morphine to ease the pain, the Nazi passes out. While he is out, Grogan examines a leather sack the German wears around his neck. Inside he finds a piece of paper with strange writing. Examining the book he finds the paper is a page that has been torn out. He replaces the paper with another page from the book and puts the original in his own pocket. When the German wakes up he is well enough to attempt the ritual. Meyer's explains that the leather pouch contains a spell that protects the person carrying it from being attacked by the demon. He tells Grogan that he will need to wear it for the ritual. Grogan gives it back to him. They head up to the demon's chamber, but find the she-devil has made progress in tearing the chain from the wall. They are forced to secure the door to the room and head back to the command center. Knowing the demon will soon break through the door they prepare a protective circle in the command center. Grogan is plagued with visions of Tane coming back to life and accusing him of cooperating with the German's, but Meyers is able to show him that this is just an illusion sent by the demon. When the demon arrives, Meyers starts the ritual while the demon paces outside the circle tempting Grogan by appearing as Helena. As the ritual reaches its climax, Grogan realizes that Meyers isn't trying to get rid of the demon, but put it under his complete power, by sacrificing a human life: Grogan's. The German comes at him with a knife, but Grogan avoids him and throws him outside of the protective circle. Meyer thinks he is okay until Grogan shows him he has switched the page in the pouch. The demon they proceeds to eat the Colonel's head. Grogan, safe under the spell page he carries, chains the demon back up in the command center, telling her that German reinforcements will be arriving soon, so she will have plenty to eat. He has no fear that she will leave the island as Meyers told him a demon of this type cannot cross running water. Grogan then departs. In a final scene we see the first German soldier (Nick Dunbar) as he arrives at the command center. He is puzzled by finding his beloved, Nicole (Jessica Grace Smith), there. As he comes to embrace her the screen fades to black and we hear screaming.|English|New Zealand|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0OTMyMDk2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzcwNDM5Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt1712578.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1712578|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt1712578&plot=full&r=json|True

And where she had befriended a girl named Bok-nam who stills writes to Hae-won asking her to visit despite the fact that Hae-won never bothered to reply. Upon arriving at the island, Hae-won is shocked to see everyone treating Bok-nam like a slave.

She begs Hae-won to help her escape the place, but Hae-won remains indifferent not wanting to be involved in complicated situations.

Count Dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced "wirgin's"] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR virgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count.

Against all odds, Pearce escaped from the most feared penal settlement of the British Empire - Sarah Island - and disappeared into the impenetrable forests of Western Tasmania. Seven convicts escaped with him, yet Pearce was the only one that emerged... along with chunks of human flesh in his pockets. The legend of Pearce was born. An extinct species... a long forgotten legend... both had a desperate need to survive; both could now have living descendants within the Tasmanian bush. Many sightings of the tiger have been reported. Many hikers have gone missing. Hundreds in fact. Zoologist Nina is convinced there are still tigers remaining in the Tasmanian wilderness, and she has proof - a photograph of a paw print snapped by her sister just before she met with a fatal accident in the bush eight years before. Unable to attain funding for an expedition, Nina fears her wish to finish her sister's work (and perhaps lay to rest recurrent nightmares she has about her sister's death) will never happen. Her partner, Matt, manages to persuade an old mate Jack to help finance the trip - at a price. Jack brings along a girlfriend, Rebecca, who uses the trip as an escape from her stifling real estate job. On their quest to find the extinct tiger, the group venture deep into isolated territory and into the domain of "Pieman" descendants. "Sarah" is a small township that passionately upholds its cannibalistic heritage in honour of the convict patriarch that gave birth to it. It needs to stay hidden to survive... but it also needs fresh "stock" to breed. The four hunters become the hunted.|English|Australia|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMDk0NTc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUyMjk5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt1064744.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1064744|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt1064744&plot=full&r=json|True

See, during class he confiscated a hat and they want it back, and on top of that, they're upset that he hasn't accepted their friend request! When he relents and accepts the request, those above him feel he's broken professional protocol and he's fired on the spot. He doesn't take too kindly to this news, and reacts by killing both the principal who fired him and an innocent secretary, guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Meanwhile, Jess is gathering her friends together for a sleepover. She talks to her mom about it and sets about making plans, but there is one minor caveat: the last time she had a sleepover, one of her friends overdosed and died. Obviously they'd like to avoid anyone dying this time around, but with Anderson now on a killing spree, that might be tough to avoid. You'd think mom would be paying attention to how many teenage girls are running around her house in their underwear (much to the delight of some booze swilling peepers just outside the window), but a hunky guy named Steve is keeping her far too distracted for that to be a possibility. The cops are soon on the case, but with Anderson's psychotic rage reaching a fever pitch, it might be a case of too little too late...|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDQ2NDQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ1MDU2MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt2553444.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2553444|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt2553444&plot=full&r=json|True

In an effort to save him, his father, Prescott Roe, seeks to purchase the dead wife's sister, Velada, from the same traveling carnival he acquired Awbonnie. The girls' father, carnival master Eamon McCree, is willing to do business, but her step-brother, Reeves, protests, putting an end to the negotiation. Desperate, Prescott kidnaps Velada and promises her the means to be rid of her father in return for comforting Talbot out of his obsession. In Talbot's madness, he guards his wife's corpse, preventing her from passing to the beyond. As a result, Awbonnie's ghost begins haunting and cursing everyone involved in the transaction of selling her as a wife. Meanwhile, Reeves and Eamon search the prairie for Velada. Drunken Eamon several times wants to turn back and leave his daughter to her own devices, but Reeves refuses. At the site of a hunting party of Indians, Eamon panics and loses his mount. Reeves continues the search alone, leaving behind the drunk, rapist father who only cared for himself, with whom he has always been disgusted. Meanwhile, the other carnival members pack up and head back east, glad to be rid of the unreasonable carnival master. At the grave-site, Talbot is distrustful of everyone who tries to separate him from Awbonnie's corpse. Her angry ghost causes a commotion with runaway horses and Prescott manages to throw what's left of the corpse on the fire. As soon as he does, Talbot seems to come to his senses, and Velada sees Awbonnie's spirit appear in the flames, finally at peace. Talbot and Prescott are able to walk away from the grave-site somewhat resigned to Awbonnie's death, and Velada presumably collects the horses and gold from her agreement with Prescott. Eamon is eventually captured by Indians and looks to be headed for an ill-fated ending.|English|France, Netherlands, UK, USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MzMxMzkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMzMjkyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0108135.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108135|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0108135&plot=full&r=json|True

tt0437363|0|Saint Francis|2007|N/A|N/A|72 min|Horror|SAINT FRANCIS Kill What You Love Francis Bernard is a liar, junky and a thief. His drug use and lack of sleep is causing him to have trouble telling the difference between reality and his imagination. Francis sees visions from two separate worlds. He sees the past in color; it is filled with horrible images pulled from the tormented corners of his life. The present is bleak, a black and white nightmare in which Francis is a trapped medical patient suffering at the hands of a mysterious surgical team. Saint Francis is a twisted family drama and the story of the decline of the Bernard family starts with the death of Francis' mother. It is 27 years ago, Francis is six years old and he watches in horror as his mother commits suicide. The images and sounds of his mother's death terrorize Francis, threatening to drive him to the same tragic destiny. As Francis' operation continues, his dreams reveal more clues as to Francis' current condition. The dreams continue and Francis watches his family self-destruct. We fast forward 27 years to see what the family has become. The patriarch of the family is Dr. P. Bernard, leader of The Church Of Forever, a cult that uses late night television evangelism to spread a gospel of science fiction. Soul Bernard, Francis' sister, is a Heidi Fleiss like Madame, brokering girls to important church members as well as her father and brother. Finally Sid, Francis' baby brother, has taken over the drug business that Francis left behind only to find himself deeply in debt to a shadowy underworld. Soul and Sid have gotten in over their heads and now owe hundreds of thousands of dollars to drug king pin Sniper. While Francis' brother and sister run around the city trying to collect enough money to keep Sniper at bay, Francis hides in his sister's house with her whores. Francis watches an endless stream of Church of Forever and schlock, Alien Abduction style TV shows. Finding himself at a breaking point and needing even more drugs to deal with the visions in his head, his addiction drives him from the safe confines of his home into the world to get his fix. Francis makes arrangements to pick up more drugs at the Church Of Forever owned club but must make a stop to get money before he can meet his connection. With no job, money or resources, Francis breaks into the TV studio where his Father, Dr P, broadcasts the daily Church Of Forever evangelical show. After Dr P disappears with one of Soul's hookers, Francis sneaks into his Father's office and steals an envelope filled with cash. Francis meets his drug connection at the club and barely avoids seeing his brother and sister. After doing a huge amount of drugs in a bathroom stall, Francis begins to hallucinate; he sees mangled images of whore girls drilling into people's brains. His visions are a mix of Church Of Forever propaganda and the twisted reality of Francis' own life. Francis begins to believe that he can see Satan coming up to Earth in the form of beautiful alien angels who are punishing the sinners and banishing them to hell. After Francis' sister commits a terrible crime out of fear and greed, Francis becomes convinced that the devil is coming after her. He believes that the only way to save his sister is to make a deal with the devil trading his soul for hers so that his sister can be saved from Hell and damnation. Are Francis' visions real or imagined? Francis must complete his twisted journey to find out if he has actually killed what he loves or if it has all been a terrible dream spun on the operating table.|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NDU4MDc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkxODk0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0437363.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437363|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0437363&plot=full&r=json|True

But to further prove Tachibana's claim, his daughter Yuri, who works for the TV news program "Digital Q," investigates strange phenomena in three separate areas in Japan (two of which involve the deaths of immoral youths), and meets a mysterious old man named Isayama, who proclaims that aside from his infamous nuclear origins, Godzilla is an accumulation of vengeful souls (of both Japanese and non-Japanese) abandoned to die in the Pacific War, and thus, mere weapons cannot kill him. While Tachibana has now been vindicated by the government, Isayama awakens the Three Sacred Guardian Beasts of Yamato, which protected Japan in its ancient past, and were then put into hibernation in the aforementioned three areas of Japan. The three monsters, King Ghidorah (sky), Mothra (water) and Baragon (earth), fight the ravaging Godzilla, while Tachibana also prepares to go into battle against his old radioactive nemesis . . .|Japanese|Japan|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNDU2Mjk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM0NjgwMzE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0279112.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279112|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0279112&plot=full&r=json|True

The church brings in lawyer David Mallory (Lochlyn Munro) to defend the priest and protect its interests. As David gathers the information he needs for the defense, he sees that things are not entirely what they appear to be.

He is actually a burglar with his arms intact. He and his accomplice, Cojo (a little person), are hiding from the police, and Alonzo views his disguise as perfect, especially since it keeps from view an unusual deformity of his left hand that would immediately give him away as the burglar. Nanon, the daughter of the circus owner, is the target in his act. Although Alonzo is in love with her, Nanon's father despises him. Nanon is attracted to Malabar, the circus strong man, but she is also repulsed by his uninhibited sexual advances and desire to touch and hold her. Apparently her phobia extends to the touch of any man. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is "armless." Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzo's face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her father's murderer. Alonzo decides to have his left arm amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. He thinks Nanon will forgive him for hiding the fact that he has ONE arm. While Alonzo is recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar.

The Dementias strike it rich when the boys' project appears on the Evening News, and it convinces a Hong Kong-based company to flood the market with an inexpensive black-market version of Microsoft Windows called Chindows. The entire Dementia Family, thanks to young Carmine and Salvadore, have now become dot-com millionaires. With the rest of the dysfunctional Dementia family sporting only grade-school educations at best, the Dementias begin to flaunt their new-found wealth.

When images of Nicholas's absent father start to appear to him, the boy is understandably frightened. This curious figure gives Nicholas the impression he is pressing his young son closer to the girls in his life and away from Bobby. This only leads to increased anxiety and fear in Nicholas. Fearing that Bobby is drifting away from him, Nicholas takes a chance and kisses him. Bobby is taken aback and storms out. Because of his shame, Bobby undergoes a type of 'splitting' where a decrepit, ghoulish version of him is separated from his healthy self.

tt0800361|5708|S&man|2006|R|10 Mar 2006|84 min|Horror|S&MAN begins with footage from Michael Powell's exploration of voyeurism, "Peeping Tom." Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called "S&Man," where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and mainstream horror classics like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" proves even more unsettling. Using interviews with Carol Clover (author off the definitive horror book, "Men, Women, and Chainsaws), and his personal experience as a horror director, Petty suggests that viewers' interest in horror films is rooted in the same voyeuristic urge to which these fetish videos appeal. Ulitmately, Petty directly confronts the audience, forcing them to examine their fascination with horror, torture, and violence. And for genre fans, these implications may make S&MAN the most unsettling horror film experience in years.|English|USA|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MTU3ODU1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE4MzU0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt0800361.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800361|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0800361&plot=full&r=json|True

Taylor set on fictional Kilton Island where strangers come together to develop their writing. Mark Twain famously said: "Write what you know". But how far would you go to find material for the ultimate bestseller? At a writer's retreat on an isolated island, novelist Zandra finds herself amongst a group of strangers confronting their darkest secrets as they write. When a member of the party mysteriously disappears, Zandra fears there is a more sinister presence trapped on the island with them. WRITERS RETREAT is filmed in a classic British Hammer Horror style using the strange features of its location to create a hauntingly terrifying film with atmosphere and menace. The script delves deep into human emotions and honesty, causing the characters to ask questions about themselves that they didn't know they had and question the audience as to whether things are quite what they seem.|English|UK|http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NzQ1Mzk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI1OTAzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg|tt4045384.jpg|http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4045384|http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt4045384&plot=full&r=json|True

In 1671, hundreds of men, women, and children suffered in bloody, torturous rituals at the hands of priests unable to contain the evil of the possessed. Were these possessions real, or is the story a hoax to cover up the sins of the deranged priests thirsty for human blood? Bill and his team of cynical paranormal investigators plan to find out the truth. As the producer and host of the reality TV show "Ghost Seekers," Bill and his crew have seen it all: abandoned prisons, haunted houses, and decrepit mental hospitals. Night after night of boring trips to empty run down buildings has left them sure that the dead stay dead and that ghosts are the furthest thing from being real. Their lack of faith will soon be repaid in blood. Armed with the church's historical record, they set out into the wilderness to uncover this series of forgotten atrocities. The demons of the past are invited to return and the gory details of old sins are revealed as the possessed begin hunting the living.

They've got to finish studying for their finals, take the tests themselves, and then school's out for good. The party has come just at the right time, and is just what Christian needs; right up until the point his sister commits suicide in an upstairs bathroom. Exams and graduation completed, Sofie's unexplained suicide is still affecting everyone concerned, especially Christian, who is convinced that Sofie was trying to tell him something before she killed herself at the party. But life has to go on, and before they all have to split up and go their own way Christian and his friends decide to go on their traditional trip to Sweden to celebrate midsummer for one last time. Although the group's usual rituals in connection with the midsummer trip aren't the same without Sofie, everyone does their best to enjoy themselves. And when Christian's long held, yet unrequited feelings for the beautiful Trine finally appear to be reciprocated, it looks like the trip is going to turn out just fine anyway. But then Christian discovers that someone - or something - has decided that Sofie's suicide should not go unexplained - and one night he wakes up with the feeling that Sofie is in the room with him. Has Sofie really come back? Or are Christian's feelings of guilt and sorrow over Sofie's apparently meaningless death making him imagine things?
